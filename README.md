# Bank & Polling Analysis

## Background

This project was designed to reflect a real-world situation where Python scripting skills are required to perform analysis on **PyBank** and  **PyPoll**.

## PyBank

The first part of this project was to create a Python script for analyzing the financial records of the PyBank company. I was provided with a set of financial data called budget_data.csv. 

The dataset was composed of two columns: `Date` and `Profit/Losses`. My responsibility was to create a Python script that analyzed the records to calculate each of the following:

  * The total number of months included in the dataset;

  * The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period;

  * The changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire and then find the average of those changes;

  * Identify the greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period;

  * Identify the greatest decrease in losses (date and amount) over the entire period.

Once the script completed, I ensured it printed the analysis to the terminal and exported a text file with the results.

## PyPoll

In the second part of the project, my responsibility was to act as a consultant for a small, rural town to modernize its vote counting process.

I was provided with a set of poll data called election_data.csv which was composed of three columns: `Voter ID`, `County`, and `Candidate`. I created a Python script that analyzed the votes and calculated each of the following:

  * The total number of votes cast;

  * A complete list of candidates who received votes;

  * The percentage of votes each candidate won;

  * The total number of votes each candidate won;

  * The winner of the election based on popular vote.

The final script printed the analysis to the terminal and exported a text file with the results.
